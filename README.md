# Rotation Count

As start to move and rotate an object see  ["britzl/defold-orthographic"](https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic).

Use Mouse to rotate Game Object around it's axis. Use Left mouse button to start rotation count.
In `/main/player.script` there is `process_rotation` function to count rotations.

BUT code breaks down to count rotations when start to use WASD to move object and Mouse to rotate simultaneously.
